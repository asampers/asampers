Hi, I’m Anna Sampers.

I taught myself programming with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails).

I’m excited to bring my coding knowledge and the skills I’ve honed from my 13-year career with an arts nonprofit (database and timeline management, cross-department coordination, clear communication with clients, attention to detail) to the web development/software engineering field. 

While I am new to the computer programming world, all of my previous roles at an arts nonprofit organization have prepared me for this career jump. I am well-versed in accurate and timely email response, calendar management with competing deadlines, and multi-tasking. I thrive in a goal oriented environment and find no task too big or small when it moves the team forward.
